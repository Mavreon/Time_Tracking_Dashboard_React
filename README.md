# Time_Tracking_Dashboard_React
A frontend mentor challenge.
In all projects I've taken on from frontend mentor, I conventionally used HTML, CSS(SCSS) and Javascript, no additional frameworks or libraries.
I decided to take on this challenge using React.js. I just started learning the framework about a week ago and used this to solidify what I've learnt so far.
What I can say is I've had tremendous growth! I'm happy to see this 😁
